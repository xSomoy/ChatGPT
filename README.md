ChatGPT: Great! Programming is a valuable skill that can be useful in a wide variety of fields and can open up many career opportunities. There are many programming languages to choose from, and the one that is right for you will depend on your goals and interests. Some popular programming languages include C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

To get started with programming, you will need to:

Choose a programming language to learn. You might want to consider factors such as the language's popularity, the types of tasks it is typically used for, and its level of difficulty.

Set up a development environment. This will typically involve installing a code editor and any necessary libraries or frameworks.

Learn the basic syntax and structure of the programming language. This will usually involve working through tutorials and exercises to get a feel for how the language works.

Practice writing and running code. The best way to learn programming is to write a lot of code, so try to work on small projects or exercises on your own to build your skills.

There are many resources available online to help you learn programming, including online tutorials, video courses, and textbooks. Some popular websites for learning programming include Codecademy, Khan Academy, and Coursera.

> write a python program that sorts files using file type as a unique parameter

```
Sure! Here is a simple Python program that sorts files in a given directory based on their file type:
```
`Code:` [Test-0](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t0-fileSort.py)
```
This code will create a dictionary with file types as keys and lists of file names as values. It will then iterate through the files in the given directory, split the file name and file extension, and add the file name to the appropriate list in the dictionary based on its file type. Finally, it will print the sorted file names for each file type.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see any other examples.
